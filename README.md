# Stellar Flare Detection: Comparing Different Unsupervised Learning Methods and Time Series Models

## Overview

This project aims to detect stellar flare using different statistical and machine learning methods. The data we analyzed is the lightcurve file from TESS for three stars: TIC 0131799991, TIC 129646813, and TIC 031381302. 


## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `Inputs` contains all original datasets and relavent documents.
    - `Data` contains raw lightcurve data from TESS.
    - `Document` contains data description and project introduction.
-   `Scripts` contains R and Jupyter notebook scripts used to clean the data and fit models.
-   `Outputs` contains all outputs including final model, paper, and cleaned data.
    -   `Assignment` contains files and figures used to generate proposal, EDA, progress report, final report and presentation.
    -   `Data` contains cleaned data after handling missing values and used to fit models.
    -   `Model` contains models for different methods.
